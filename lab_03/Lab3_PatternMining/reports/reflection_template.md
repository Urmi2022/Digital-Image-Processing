# Lab 3 — Reflection (Template)

**Q1. What’s a surprising pair you found?**  
<Write your answer here and include the co-occurrence count and/or the rule’s support/confidence if relevant.>

**Q2. What was hard about finding patterns?**  
<Discuss data issues (noise, imbalance), parameter sensitivity (support/confidence), or computational constraints.>

**Q3. What would you explore next?**  
<Propose follow-ups: topic-specific stopwords, POS filtering, lemmatization vs. stemming, merging vs. separate datasets, windowed co-occurrence by time, etc.>

### Sample Comparison (for your self-check)
- You might find patterns like "online • class", "exam • stress", or "ai • tools".
- Strong rules often involve domain terms co-appearing with qualifiers (e.g., "online, class" ⇒ "lecture").
- Be wary of trivial pairs dominated by stopwords or boilerplate.

> Remember to label each insight with metrics (support, confidence, lift) when applicable.
