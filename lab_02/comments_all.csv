It can tell if it's a finger touching it compared to your pocket or whatever, so you won't activate it accidentally. The placement is also meant to encourage horizontal/landscape photography that will utilize the new spatial arrangement of the cameras. Spatial photography and video should be the default, and this is also designed to make the best videos for VR.. aka Vision Pro.

I took it to the service center, and they informed me that the motherboard is dead. When I asked for an explanation, their response was simply that it died with no further clarification. Now, they are asking me to pay ₹35,000 (around $420) to replace the motherboard. Seriously, the motherboard just died? What happened to the premium Apple assurance?

I have money to buy a new iPhone, but I'm still on the 11 and it's working perfectly.  I'm going to upgrade from 11 to 16 pro and honestly this is a huge upgrade for me. And I absolutely know that when I want to upgrade the 16 to a newer device, it will be a huge upgrade too. The problem is that people always want to have the latest just to brag about it.

This is probably enough to make people feel weird when looking at the images, considering these cameras are also not spaced the correct distance apart laterally (meaning they're not providing as much depth information as we'd like at regular scale, but actually quite good for very close up things).",1725235200,1,

While their current „flaweless“ working iPhone as they stated is still flawless even in the case the new model might be awesome. So what’s about the complaining about that all the new iPhones aren’t better enough? Some people have a broke iPhone and will buy a new one anyways.
