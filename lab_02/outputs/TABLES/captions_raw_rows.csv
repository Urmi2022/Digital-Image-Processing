00:00:03.990,00:00:04.000,so I just got these boxes in from China,3.99,4.0,3.995,39
00:00:04.000,00:00:05.630,so I just got these boxes in from China and you can probably tell from the,4.0,5.63,4.8149999999999995,74
00:00:05.630,00:00:05.640,and you can probably tell from the,5.63,5.64,5.635,34
00:00:05.640,00:00:08.110,and you can probably tell from the labels that there's something iPhone,5.64,8.11,6.875,71
00:00:08.110,00:00:08.120,labels that there's something iPhone,8.11,8.12,8.114999999999998,36
00:00:08.120,00:00:10.990,labels that there's something iPhone related inside well I mean these numbers,8.12,10.99,9.555,77
00:00:10.990,00:00:11.000,related inside well I mean these numbers,10.99,11.0,10.995000000000001,40
00:00:11.000,00:00:14.070,related inside well I mean these numbers indicate that 16 Pro Max 16 plus these,11.0,14.07,12.535,79
00:00:14.070,00:00:14.080,indicate that 16 Pro Max 16 plus these,14.07,14.08,14.075,38
00:00:14.080,00:00:19.470,indicate that 16 Pro Max 16 plus these are obviously not the official iPhone 16,14.08,19.47,16.775,79
00:00:19.470,00:00:19.480,are obviously not the official iPhone 16,19.47,19.48,19.475,40
00:00:19.480,00:00:22.670,are obviously not the official iPhone 16 products those don't exist yet however,19.48,22.67,21.075000000000003,79
00:00:22.670,00:00:22.680,products those don't exist yet however,22.67,22.68,22.675,38
00:00:22.680,00:00:25.429,products those don't exist yet however inside is the closest look I guess you,22.68,25.429,24.054499999999997,77
00:00:25.429,00:00:25.439,inside is the closest look I guess you,25.429,25.439,25.433999999999997,38
00:00:25.439,00:00:27.509,inside is the closest look I guess you can get at the moment of what those,25.439,27.509,26.474,74
00:00:27.509,00:00:27.519,can get at the moment of what those,27.509,27.519,27.514,35
00:00:27.519,00:00:29.470,can get at the moment of what those phones are going to look like because,27.519,29.47,28.4945,73
00:00:29.470,00:00:29.480,phones are going to look like because,29.47,29.48,29.475,37
00:00:29.480,00:00:30.910,phones are going to look like because these things,29.48,30.91,30.195,50
00:00:30.910,00:00:30.920,these things,30.91,30.92,30.915,12
00:00:30.920,00:00:33.990,these things always come out of China prior to the,30.92,33.99,32.455,50
00:00:33.990,00:00:34.000,always come out of China prior to the,33.99,34.0,33.995000000000005,37
00:00:34.000,00:00:37.110,always come out of China prior to the actual iPhone launch so let's start by,34.0,37.11,35.555,76
00:00:37.110,00:00:37.120,actual iPhone launch so let's start by,37.11,37.12,37.114999999999995,38
00:00:37.120,00:00:40.389,actual iPhone launch so let's start by unboxing the one that's labeled,37.12,40.389,38.7545,70
00:00:40.389,00:00:40.399,unboxing the one that's labeled,40.389,40.399,40.394000000000005,31
00:00:40.399,00:00:43.670,unboxing the one that's labeled 16 and the shocking thing that you're,40.399,43.67,42.0345,69
00:00:43.670,00:00:43.680,16 and the shocking thing that you're,43.67,43.68,43.675,37
00:00:43.680,00:00:46.430,16 and the shocking thing that you're going to notice immediately is the new,43.68,46.43,45.055,76
00:00:46.430,00:00:46.440,going to notice immediately is the new,46.43,46.44,46.435,38
00:00:46.440,00:00:49.510,going to notice immediately is the new layout of the camera section and you're,46.44,49.51,47.974999999999994,78
00:00:49.510,00:00:49.520,layout of the camera section and you're,49.51,49.52,49.515,39
00:00:49.520,00:00:51.189,layout of the camera section and you're going to decide right now whether you,49.52,51.189,50.3545,77
00:00:51.189,00:00:51.199,going to decide right now whether you,51.189,51.199,51.194,37
00:00:51.199,00:00:56.029,going to decide right now whether you love or hate this decision by Apple to,51.199,56.029,53.614000000000004,76
00:00:56.029,00:00:56.039,love or hate this decision by Apple to,56.029,56.039,56.034000000000006,38
00:00:56.039,00:00:58.509,love or hate this decision by Apple to change this area because obviously in,56.039,58.509,57.274,76
00:00:58.509,00:00:58.519,change this area because obviously in,58.509,58.519,58.513999999999996,37
00:00:58.519,00:01:00.349,change this area because obviously in the past it looked quite a bit different,58.519,60.349,59.434,78
00:01:00.349,00:01:00.359,the past it looked quite a bit different,60.349,60.359,60.354,40
00:01:00.359,00:01:04.750,the past it looked quite a bit different so here is the iPhone 15 compared to the,60.359,64.75,62.554500000000004,81
00:01:04.750,00:01:04.760,so here is the iPhone 15 compared to the,64.75,64.76,64.755,40
00:01:04.760,00:01:07.630,so here is the iPhone 15 compared to the iPhone 16 and I don't know this was kind,64.76,67.63,66.195,81
00:01:07.630,00:01:07.640,iPhone 16 and I don't know this was kind,67.63,67.64,67.63499999999999,40
00:01:07.640,00:01:11.310,iPhone 16 and I don't know this was kind of intriguing the diagonal layout it was,67.64,71.31,69.475,81
00:01:11.310,00:01:11.320,of intriguing the diagonal layout it was,71.31,71.32,71.315,40
00:01:11.320,00:01:14.149,of intriguing the diagonal layout it was distinctive you knew it was an iPhone,71.32,74.149,72.7345,78
00:01:14.149,00:01:14.159,distinctive you knew it was an iPhone,74.149,74.159,74.154,37
00:01:14.159,00:01:16.950,distinctive you knew it was an iPhone whereas this layout is a little bit more,74.159,76.95,75.5545,78
00:01:16.950,00:01:16.960,whereas this layout is a little bit more,76.95,76.96000000000001,76.95500000000001,40
00:01:16.960,00:01:19.590,whereas this layout is a little bit more typical obviously some other interesting,76.96000000000001,79.59,78.275,81
00:01:19.590,00:01:19.600,typical obviously some other interesting,79.59,79.6,79.595,40
00:01:19.600,00:01:21.590,typical obviously some other interesting findings here we have this is this going,79.6,81.59,80.595,81
00:01:21.590,00:01:21.600,findings here we have this is this going,81.59,81.6,81.595,40
00:01:21.600,00:01:23.670,findings here we have this is this going to be a secondary button it's not going,81.6,83.67,82.63499999999999,80
00:01:23.670,00:01:23.680,to be a secondary button it's not going,83.67,83.68,83.67500000000001,39
00:01:23.680,00:01:26.990,to be a secondary button it's not going to be removable storage obviously anyway,83.68,86.99,85.33500000000001,80
00:01:26.990,00:01:27.000,to be removable storage obviously anyway,86.99,87.0,86.995,40
00:01:27.000,00:01:28.990,to be removable storage obviously anyway a dedicated button for Apple,87.0,88.99,87.995,69
00:01:28.990,00:01:29.000,a dedicated button for Apple,88.99,89.0,88.995,28
00:01:29.000,00:01:30.870,a dedicated button for Apple intelligence yeah sure maybe obviously,89.0,90.87,89.935,67
00:01:30.870,00:01:30.880,intelligence yeah sure maybe obviously,90.87,90.88,90.875,38
00:01:30.880,00:01:33.190,intelligence yeah sure maybe obviously we have this little button here where,90.88,93.19,92.035,76
00:01:33.190,00:01:33.200,we have this little button here where,93.19,93.2,93.195,37

00:01:36.429,00:01:36.439,you used to have the switch but then,96.429,96.439,96.434,36
00:01:36.439,00:01:39.910,you used to have the switch but then that changed on the Pro Models we have,96.439,99.91,98.1745,75
00:01:39.910,00:01:39.920,that changed on the Pro Models we have,99.91,99.92,99.91499999999999,38
00:01:39.920,00:01:42.870,that changed on the Pro Models we have our volume buttons individual and then,99.92,102.87,101.39500000000001,77
00:01:42.870,00:01:42.880,our volume buttons individual and then,102.87,102.88,102.875,38

00:02:04.200,00:02:06.870,purposes I'm sure now the colors what can we learn from it honestly we never,124.2,126.87,125.535,76
00:02:06.870,00:02:06.880,can we learn from it honestly we never,126.87,126.88,126.875,38
00:02:06.880,00:02:09.430,can we learn from it honestly we never really know sometimes these early,126.88,129.43,128.155,72
00:02:09.430,00:02:09.440,really know sometimes these early,129.43,129.44,129.435,33
00:02:09.440,00:02:12.630,really know sometimes these early samples will have colors that don't end,129.44,132.63,131.035,73
00:02:12.630,00:02:12.640,samples will have colors that don't end,132.63,132.64,132.635,39
00:02:12.640,00:02:15.670,samples will have colors that don't end up coming to fruition but this is like a,132.64,135.67,134.15499999999997,80
00:02:15.670,00:02:15.680,up coming to fruition but this is like a,135.67,135.68,135.675,40
00:02:15.680,00:02:18.470,up coming to fruition but this is like a pale pink type of color the frame,135.68,138.47,137.075,74
00:02:18.470,00:02:18.480,pale pink type of color the frame,138.47,138.48,138.475,33
00:02:18.480,00:02:21.630,pale pink type of color the frame however looks like a typical aluminum,138.48,141.63,140.055,71
00:02:21.630,00:02:21.640,however looks like a typical aluminum,141.63,141.64,141.635,37
00:02:21.640,00:02:24.150,however looks like a typical aluminum color it doesn't have a very strong pink,141.64,144.15,142.89499999999998,78
00:02:24.150,00:02:24.160,color it doesn't have a very strong pink,144.15,144.16,144.155,40
00:02:24.160,00:02:28.150,color it doesn't have a very strong pink tone on this particular model otherwise,144.16,148.15,146.155,80
00:02:28.150,00:02:28.160,tone on this particular model otherwise,148.15,148.16,148.155,39
00:02:28.160,00:02:30.790,tone on this particular model otherwise the dimensions here look fairly,148.16,150.79,149.475,71
00:02:30.790,00:02:30.800,the dimensions here look fairly,150.79,150.8,150.79500000000002,31
00:02:30.800,00:02:33.589,the dimensions here look fairly identical height and width if I look at,150.8,153.589,152.1945,71
00:02:33.589,00:02:33.599,identical height and width if I look at,153.589,153.599,153.594,39
00:02:33.599,00:02:36.869,identical height and width if I look at them from the front almost no changes to,153.599,156.869,155.23399999999998,80
00:02:36.869,00:02:36.879,them from the front almost no changes to,156.869,156.879,156.874,40
00:02:36.879,00:02:39.550,them from the front almost no changes to the form factor by the looks of it and,156.879,159.55,158.2145,79
00:02:39.550,00:02:39.560,the form factor by the looks of it and,159.55,159.56,159.555,38
00:02:39.560,00:02:42.390,the form factor by the looks of it and the biggest change occurring in this,159.56,162.39,160.975,75
00:02:42.390,00:02:42.400,the biggest change occurring in this,162.39,162.4,162.39499999999998,36
00:02:42.400,00:02:44.149,the biggest change occurring in this camera department and then obviously,162.4,164.149,163.2745,73
00:02:44.149,00:02:44.159,camera department and then obviously,164.149,164.159,164.154,36
00:02:44.159,00:02:46.070,camera department and then obviously with your colors hopefully we have some,164.159,166.07,165.1145,76

00:02:48.149,00:02:48.159,different colors here with the other,168.149,168.159,168.154,36
00:02:48.159,00:02:51.589,different colors here with the other models so we can compare this is labeled,168.159,171.589,169.874,77
00:02:51.589,00:02:51.599,models so we can compare this is labeled,171.589,171.599,171.594,40
00:02:51.599,00:02:55.550,models so we can compare this is labeled as 16 plus this gives us a glimpse at,171.599,175.55,173.5745,78
00:02:55.550,00:02:55.560,as 16 plus this gives us a glimpse at,175.55,175.56,175.555,37
00:02:55.560,00:02:58.309,as 16 plus this gives us a glimpse at the,175.56,178.309,176.9345,41
00:02:58.309,00:02:58.319,the,178.309,178.31900000000002,178.31400000000002,3

00:03:01.030,00:03:01.040,black screen protector it's kind of,181.03,181.04,181.035,35
00:03:01.040,00:03:03.350,black screen protector it's kind of funny having a screen protector on a,181.04,183.35,182.195,72
00:03:03.350,00:03:03.360,funny having a screen protector on a,183.35,183.36,183.35500000000002,36
00:03:03.360,00:03:06.710,funny having a screen protector on a mockup model phone so same camera,183.36,186.71,185.03500000000003,70
00:03:06.710,00:03:06.720,mockup model phone so same camera,186.71,186.72,186.715,33
00:03:06.720,00:03:10.390,mockup model phone so same camera section A brushed or matte finish on the,186.72,190.39,188.555,74
00:03:10.390,00:03:10.400,section A brushed or matte finish on the,190.39,190.4,190.39499999999998,40
00:03:10.400,00:03:13.750,section A brushed or matte finish on the frame in Black it does not feel titanium,190.4,193.75,192.075,81
00:03:13.750,00:03:13.760,frame in Black it does not feel titanium,193.75,193.76,193.755,40
00:03:13.760,00:03:16.470,frame in Black it does not feel titanium in the form of this model but I would,193.76,196.47,195.115,78
00:03:16.470,00:03:16.480,in the form of this model but I would,196.47,196.48,196.475,37
00:03:16.480,00:03:18.630,in the form of this model but I would assume they would keep the titanium,196.48,198.63,197.555,73
00:03:18.630,00:03:18.640,assume they would keep the titanium,198.63,198.64,198.635,35
00:03:18.640,00:03:21.190,assume they would keep the titanium aspect for the Pro Models I don't know,198.64,201.19,199.915,74
00:03:21.190,00:03:21.200,aspect for the Pro Models I don't know,201.19,201.2,201.195,38
00:03:21.200,00:03:23.270,aspect for the Pro Models I don't know these feel a little bit heavier what,201.2,203.27,202.235,75
00:03:23.270,00:03:23.280,these feel a little bit heavier what,203.27,203.28,203.275,36
00:03:23.280,00:03:25.910,these feel a little bit heavier what does that mean on these I don't know but,203.28,205.91,204.595,77
00:03:25.910,00:03:25.920,does that mean on these I don't know but,205.91,205.92000000000002,205.91500000000002,40
00:03:25.920,00:03:27.670,does that mean on these I don't know but the materials on this feel more,205.92000000000002,207.67000000000002,206.79500000000002,72
00:03:27.670,00:03:27.680,the materials on this feel more,207.67000000000002,207.68,207.675,31
00:03:27.680,00:03:29.949,the materials on this feel more plasticky obviously than the actual,207.68,209.949,208.8145,67
00:03:29.949,00:03:29.959,plasticky obviously than the actual,209.949,209.959,209.954,35
00:03:29.959,00:03:33.070,plasticky obviously than the actual official iPhone but this is your plus,209.959,213.07,211.5145,73
00:03:33.070,00:03:33.080,official iPhone but this is your plus,213.07,213.07999999999998,213.075,37
00:03:33.080,00:03:35.630,official iPhone but this is your plus variant same alteration so I'll pull,213.07999999999998,215.63,214.355,74
00:03:35.630,00:03:35.640,variant same alteration so I'll pull,215.63,215.64,215.635,36
00:03:35.640,00:03:38.589,variant same alteration so I'll pull over the existing plus and there you can,215.64,218.589,217.1145,77
00:03:38.589,00:03:38.599,over the existing plus and there you can,218.589,218.599,218.594,40
00:03:38.599,00:03:42.149,over the existing plus and there you can see the difference form factor looking,218.599,222.149,220.374,79
00:03:42.149,00:03:42.159,see the difference form factor looking,222.149,222.159,222.154,38
00:03:42.159,00:03:45.309,see the difference form factor looking fairly identical again if not exact,222.159,225.309,223.73399999999998,74
00:03:45.309,00:03:45.319,fairly identical again if not exact,225.309,225.31900000000002,225.31400000000002,35
00:03:45.319,00:03:49.509,fairly identical again if not exact height WID yeah sometimes these change,225.31900000000002,229.50900000000001,227.41400000000002,74
00:03:49.509,00:03:49.519,height WID yeah sometimes these change,229.50900000000001,229.519,229.514,38
00:03:49.519,00:03:53.149,height WID yeah sometimes these change slightly but not this generation it,229.519,233.149,231.334,74
00:03:53.149,00:03:53.159,slightly but not this generation it,233.149,233.159,233.154,35
00:03:53.159,00:03:55.550,slightly but not this generation it appears these are like I said almost,233.159,235.55,234.3545,72
00:03:55.550,00:03:55.560,appears these are like I said almost,235.55,235.56,235.555,36
00:03:55.560,00:03:59.030,appears these are like I said almost exact now the plus model still has this,235.56,239.03,237.29500000000002,76
00:03:59.030,00:03:59.040,exact now the plus model still has this,239.03,239.04,239.035,39
00:03:59.040,00:04:01.270,exact now the plus model still has this secondary button section which is tough,239.04,241.27,240.155,79
00:04:01.270,00:04:01.280,secondary button section which is tough,241.27,241.28,241.275,39
00:04:01.280,00:04:03.350,secondary button section which is tough to see on the black variant so whatever,241.28,243.35,242.315,79
00:04:03.350,00:04:03.360,to see on the black variant so whatever,243.35,243.36,243.35500000000002,39
00:04:03.360,00:04:05.229,to see on the black variant so whatever that ends up being will says Apple,243.36,245.229,244.29450000000003,74
00:04:05.229,00:04:05.239,that ends up being will says Apple,245.229,245.239,245.234,34
00:04:05.239,00:04:07.470,that ends up being will says Apple intelligence which would be very cool if,245.239,247.47,246.3545,75
00:04:07.470,00:04:07.480,intelligence which would be very cool if,247.47,247.48,247.475,40
00:04:07.480,00:04:09.390,intelligence which would be very cool if that was the case but maybe even if it,247.48,249.39,248.435,79
00:04:09.390,00:04:09.400,that was the case but maybe even if it,249.39,249.4,249.39499999999998,38
00:04:09.400,00:04:10.990,that was the case but maybe even if it was just a programmable button that,249.4,250.99,250.195,74
00:04:10.990,00:04:11.000,was just a programmable button that,250.99,251.0,250.995,35
00:04:11.000,00:04:12.509,was just a programmable button that would be cool it feel comfortable,251.0,252.50900000000001,251.7545,69
00:04:12.509,00:04:12.519,would be cool it feel comfortable,252.50900000000001,252.519,252.514,33
00:04:12.519,00:04:14.470,would be cool it feel comfortable holding that pressing that but yeah,252.519,254.47,253.49450000000002,69
00:04:14.470,00:04:14.480,holding that pressing that but yeah,254.47,254.48,254.475,35
00:04:14.480,00:04:16.069,holding that pressing that but yeah that's that area yeah you can press it,254.48,256.069,255.2745,74

00:04:23.230,00:04:23.240,other hand is lining right up with that,263.23,263.24,263.235,39
00:04:23.240,00:04:25.510,other hand is lining right up with that now if you go to the smaller phone same,263.24,265.51,264.375,79
00:04:25.510,00:04:25.520,now if you go to the smaller phone same,265.51,265.52,265.515,39

00:04:31.720,00:04:34.070,press here slide down a little bit it's this motion got to do this Motion in,271.72,274.07,272.895,76
00:04:34.070,00:04:34.080,this motion got to do this Motion in,274.07,274.08,274.075,36
00:04:34.080,00:04:38.830,this motion got to do this Motion in your hand and next we have a pro model,274.08,278.83,276.455,75
00:04:38.830,00:04:38.840,your hand and next we have a pro model,278.83,278.84000000000003,278.83500000000004,38
00:04:38.840,00:04:41.189,your hand and next we have a pro model also in black and we have obviously a,278.84000000000003,281.189,280.0145,76
00:04:41.189,00:04:41.199,also in black and we have obviously a,281.189,281.199,281.194,37
00:04:41.199,00:04:44.350,also in black and we have obviously a much bigger camera section but the same,281.199,284.35,282.7745,77
00:04:44.350,00:04:44.360,much bigger camera section but the same,284.35,284.36,284.355,39
00:04:44.360,00:04:46.350,much bigger camera section but the same layout that we're used to on the,284.36,286.35,285.355,72
00:04:46.350,00:04:46.360,layout that we're used to on the,286.35,286.36,286.355,32
00:04:46.360,00:04:48.909,layout that we're used to on the existing Pro now the materials feel,286.36,288.909,287.6345,68
00:04:48.909,00:04:48.919,existing Pro now the materials feel,288.909,288.919,288.914,35
00:04:48.919,00:04:50.870,existing Pro now the materials feel identical between these two I don't,288.919,290.87,289.8945,71
00:04:50.870,00:04:50.880,identical between these two I don't,290.87,290.88,290.875,35
00:04:50.880,00:04:52.670,identical between these two I don't imagine that these are indicative of the,290.88,292.67,291.775,76
00:04:52.670,00:04:52.680,imagine that these are indicative of the,292.67,292.68,292.675,40
00:04:52.680,00:04:54.670,imagine that these are indicative of the actual materials that Apple will be,292.68,294.67,293.675,76
00:04:54.670,00:04:54.680,actual materials that Apple will be,294.67,294.68,294.675,35
00:04:54.680,00:04:56.909,actual materials that Apple will be using in any way sometimes the colors as,294.68,296.909,295.79449999999997,76
00:04:56.909,00:04:56.919,using in any way sometimes the colors as,296.909,296.919,296.914,40
00:04:56.919,00:04:58.790,using in any way sometimes the colors as I mentioned are and if that's the case,296.919,298.79,297.85450000000003,79
00:04:58.790,00:04:58.800,I mentioned are and if that's the case,298.79,298.8,298.795,38
00:04:58.800,00:05:01.830,I mentioned are and if that's the case then this black variant is quite black,298.8,301.83,300.315,77
00:05:01.830,00:05:01.840,then this black variant is quite black,301.83,301.84,301.835,38
00:05:01.840,00:05:04.070,then this black variant is quite black maybe more black than recent kind of,301.84,304.07,302.955,75
00:05:04.070,00:05:04.080,maybe more black than recent kind of,304.07,304.08,304.075,36
00:05:04.080,00:05:06.670,maybe more black than recent kind of almost black colors that Apple has used,304.08,306.67,305.375,76
00:05:06.670,00:05:06.680,almost black colors that Apple has used,306.67,306.68,306.675,39
00:05:06.680,00:05:09.350,almost black colors that Apple has used and if I pull over the existing Pro I,306.68,309.35,308.015,77
00:05:09.350,00:05:09.360,and if I pull over the existing Pro I,309.35,309.36,309.355,37
00:05:09.360,00:05:12.270,and if I pull over the existing Pro I have a device that is actually a little,309.36,312.27,310.815,77
00:05:12.270,00:05:12.280,have a device that is actually a little,312.27,312.28,312.275,39
00:05:12.280,00:05:14.629,have a device that is actually a little bit taller that's interesting so not,312.28,314.629,313.4545,76
00:05:14.629,00:05:14.639,bit taller that's interesting so not,314.629,314.639,314.634,36
00:05:14.639,00:05:16.870,bit taller that's interesting so not identical in this case this is a little,314.639,316.87,315.7545,76
00:05:16.870,00:05:16.880,identical in this case this is a little,316.87,316.88,316.875,39
00:05:16.880,00:05:19.189,identical in this case this is a little touch taller how much taller let's find,316.88,319.189,318.0345,79
00:05:19.189,00:05:19.199,touch taller how much taller let's find,319.189,319.199,319.194,39
00:05:19.199,00:05:22.790,touch taller how much taller let's find out so old model calipers have the old,319.199,322.79,320.9945,78
00:05:22.790,00:05:22.800,out so old model calipers have the old,322.79,322.8,322.795,38
00:05:22.800,00:05:29.990,out so old model calipers have the old one at 146.820,322.8,329.99,326.395,53
00:05:36.150,00:05:36.160,in the new one 5.89 in or,336.15,336.15999999999997,336.155,25
00:05:36.160,00:05:40.350,in the new one 5.89 in or 149.6 mm so yes this form factor has,336.15999999999997,340.35,338.255,62
00:05:40.350,00:05:40.360,149.6 mm so yes this form factor has,340.35,340.36,340.355,36
00:05:40.360,00:05:45.110,149.6 mm so yes this form factor has changed slightly let's check width,340.36,345.11,342.735,71
00:05:45.110,00:05:45.120,changed slightly let's check width,345.11,345.12,345.115,34
00:05:45.120,00:05:49.110,changed slightly let's check width 7144,345.12,349.11,347.115,39
00:05:52.350,00:05:52.360,2.81 oh that's a lot closer to identical,352.35,352.36,352.355,40
00:05:52.360,00:05:56.270,2.81 oh that's a lot closer to identical 2.8 or 7113 that's that could just be,352.36,356.27,354.315,78
00:05:56.270,00:05:56.280,2.8 or 7113 that's that could just be,356.27,356.28,356.275,37
00:05:56.280,00:05:57.830,2.8 or 7113 that's that could just be material differences that's not a,356.28,357.83,357.05499999999995,71
00:05:57.830,00:05:57.840,material differences that's not a,357.83,357.84000000000003,357.83500000000004,33
00:05:57.840,00:05:59.990,material differences that's not a significant alteration compared to that,357.84000000000003,359.99,358.915,73
00:05:59.990,00:06:00.000,significant alteration compared to that,359.99,360.0,359.995,39
00:06:00.000,00:06:01.870,significant alteration compared to that height that height has definitely,360.0,361.87,360.935,73
00:06:01.870,00:06:01.880,height that height has definitely,361.87,361.88,361.875,33
00:06:01.880,00:06:05.670,height that height has definitely changed if these early mockups are,361.88,365.67,363.775,68
00:06:05.670,00:06:05.680,changed if these early mockups are,365.67,365.68,365.675,34
00:06:05.680,00:06:08.029,changed if these early mockups are accurate then the next iPhone the iPhone,365.68,368.029,366.85450000000003,75
00:06:08.029,00:06:08.039,accurate then the next iPhone the iPhone,368.029,368.039,368.034,40
00:06:08.039,00:06:12.110,accurate then the next iPhone the iPhone 16 Pro will be taller than the iPhone 15,368.039,372.11,370.0745,81
00:06:12.110,00:06:12.120,16 Pro will be taller than the iPhone 15,372.11,372.12,372.115,40
00:06:12.120,00:06:15.830,16 Pro will be taller than the iPhone 15 Pro let's check out the pro,372.12,375.83,373.975,68
00:06:15.830,00:06:15.840,Pro let's check out the pro,375.83,375.84,375.835,27
00:06:15.840,00:06:19.029,Pro let's check out the pro Max here it looks like we have a 16 Pro,375.84,379.029,377.43449999999996,67
00:06:19.029,00:06:19.039,Max here it looks like we have a 16 Pro,379.029,379.039,379.034,39

00:06:23.270,00:06:23.280,Max in white and silver same button,383.27,383.28,383.275,35
00:06:23.280,00:06:27.110,Max in white and silver same button layout huge phone obviously even bigger,383.28,387.11,385.195,75
00:06:27.110,00:06:27.120,layout huge phone obviously even bigger,387.11,387.12,387.115,39
00:06:27.120,00:06:28.870,layout huge phone obviously even bigger than the plus the other interesting,387.12,388.87,387.995,75
00:06:28.870,00:06:28.880,than the plus the other interesting,388.87,388.88,388.875,35
00:06:28.880,00:06:30.670,than the plus the other interesting thing here we have this same matte,388.88,390.67,389.775,70
00:06:30.670,00:06:30.680,thing here we have this same matte,390.67,390.68,390.675,34
00:06:30.680,00:06:33.629,thing here we have this same matte finish on Pro and non-pro models and if,390.68,393.629,392.1545,74
00:06:33.629,00:06:33.639,finish on Pro and non-pro models and if,393.629,393.639,393.634,39
00:06:33.639,00:06:36.230,finish on Pro and non-pro models and if we compare this to the existing Pro Max,393.639,396.23,394.9345,79
00:06:36.230,00:06:36.240,we compare this to the existing Pro Max,396.23,396.24,396.235,39
00:06:36.240,00:06:39.710,we compare this to the existing Pro Max we have the same situation of a taller,396.24,399.71,397.975,78
00:06:39.710,00:06:39.720,we have the same situation of a taller,399.71,399.72,399.71500000000003,38
00:06:39.720,00:06:42.909,we have the same situation of a taller phone by an almost identical margin to,399.72,402.909,401.3145,77
00:06:42.909,00:06:42.919,phone by an almost identical margin to,402.909,402.919,402.914,38
00:06:42.919,00:06:46.309,phone by an almost identical margin to the pro model and the width once again,402.919,406.30899999999997,404.614,77
00:06:46.309,00:06:46.319,the pro model and the width once again,406.30899999999997,406.319,406.31399999999996,38
00:06:46.319,00:06:48.309,the pro model and the width once again looks to be close to,406.319,408.30899999999997,407.31399999999996,59
00:06:48.309,00:06:48.319,looks to be close to,408.30899999999997,408.319,408.31399999999996,20
00:06:48.319,00:06:50.710,looks to be close to identical with a little bit of tolerance,408.319,410.71,409.5145,61
00:06:50.710,00:06:50.720,identical with a little bit of tolerance,410.71,410.72,410.71500000000003,40
00:06:50.720,00:06:52.990,identical with a little bit of tolerance for the material differences from the,410.72,412.99,411.855,78
00:06:52.990,00:06:53.000,for the material differences from the,412.99,413.0,412.995,37
00:06:53.000,00:06:56.390,for the material differences from the actual iPhone to this model so I don't,413.0,416.39,414.695,76
00:06:56.390,00:06:56.400,actual iPhone to this model so I don't,416.39,416.4,416.395,38
00:06:56.400,00:06:58.350,actual iPhone to this model so I don't think that's significant but,416.4,418.35,417.375,67
00:06:58.350,00:06:58.360,think that's significant but,418.35,418.36,418.355,28
00:06:58.360,00:07:01.309,think that's significant but height is is significant and it should,418.36,421.309,419.83450000000005,67
00:07:01.309,00:07:01.319,height is is significant and it should,421.309,421.319,421.314,38
00:07:01.319,00:07:05.950,height is is significant and it should allow the display inside to grow ever so,421.319,425.95,423.6345,79
00:07:05.950,00:07:05.960,allow the display inside to grow ever so,425.95,425.96,425.955,40
00:07:05.960,00:07:10.029,allow the display inside to grow ever so slightly with that small increase so if,425.96,430.029,427.9945,80
00:07:10.029,00:07:10.039,slightly with that small increase so if,430.029,430.039,430.034,39
00:07:10.039,00:07:11.550,slightly with that small increase so if you are thinking about picking up a new,430.039,431.55,430.79449999999997,79
00:07:11.550,00:07:11.560,you are thinking about picking up a new,431.55,431.56,431.555,39
00:07:11.560,00:07:14.230,you are thinking about picking up a new iPhone iPhone 16 then we will absolutely,431.56,434.23,432.895,80
00:07:14.230,00:07:14.240,iPhone iPhone 16 then we will absolutely,434.23,434.24,434.235,40
00:07:14.240,00:07:16.710,iPhone iPhone 16 then we will absolutely have you covered with later case,434.24,436.71,435.475,73
00:07:16.710,00:07:16.720,have you covered with later case,436.71,436.72,436.71500000000003,32
00:07:16.720,00:07:18.869,have you covered with later case products these of course are,436.72,438.869,437.7945,61
00:07:18.869,00:07:18.879,products these of course are,438.869,438.879,438.874,28
00:07:18.879,00:07:22.629,products these of course are extremely thin phone cases that are made,438.879,442.629,440.754,69
00:07:22.629,00:07:22.639,extremely thin phone cases that are made,442.629,442.639,442.634,40
00:07:22.639,00:07:25.230,extremely thin phone cases that are made of DuPont Kevlar and they're pretty much,442.639,445.23,443.9345,81
00:07:25.230,00:07:25.240,of DuPont Kevlar and they're pretty much,445.23,445.24,445.235,40
00:07:25.240,00:07:27.309,of DuPont Kevlar and they're pretty much as thin as you can get that material is,445.24,447.309,446.2745,80
00:07:27.309,00:07:27.319,as thin as you can get that material is,447.309,447.319,447.314,39
00:07:27.319,00:07:29.309,as thin as you can get that material is chosen for the fact that you can make it,447.319,449.309,448.314,80
00:07:29.309,00:07:29.319,chosen for the fact that you can make it,449.309,449.319,449.314,40
00:07:29.319,00:07:30.909,chosen for the fact that you can make it this thin but still have it strong,449.319,450.909,450.11400000000003,75
00:07:30.909,00:07:30.919,this thin but still have it strong,450.909,450.919,450.914,34
00:07:30.919,00:07:32.869,this thin but still have it strong enough to be rigid and the beauty here,450.919,452.869,451.894,73
00:07:32.869,00:07:32.879,enough to be rigid and the beauty here,452.869,452.879,452.874,38
00:07:32.879,00:07:35.510,enough to be rigid and the beauty here is that you get to use your phone closer,452.879,455.51,454.1945,79
00:07:35.510,00:07:35.520,is that you get to use your phone closer,455.51,455.52,455.515,40
00:07:35.520,00:07:37.230,is that you get to use your phone closer to the way that it was intended to be,455.52,457.23,456.375,78
00:07:37.230,00:07:37.240,to the way that it was intended to be,457.23,457.24,457.235,37
00:07:37.240,00:07:39.830,to the way that it was intended to be used by the manufacturer because you've,457.24,459.83,458.53499999999997,77
00:07:39.830,00:07:39.840,used by the manufacturer because you've,459.83,459.84000000000003,459.83500000000004,39
00:07:39.840,00:07:42.150,used by the manufacturer because you've got such a thin form factor it really,459.84000000000003,462.15,460.995,77
00:07:42.150,00:07:42.160,got such a thin form factor it really,462.15,462.15999999999997,462.155,37
00:07:42.160,00:07:44.029,got such a thin form factor it really feels like you're holding your phone,462.15999999999997,464.029,463.0945,74
00:07:44.029,00:07:44.039,feels like you're holding your phone,464.029,464.039,464.034,36
00:07:44.039,00:07:48.110,feels like you're holding your phone with no case at all this is a later case,464.039,468.11,466.0745,77
00:07:48.110,00:07:48.120,with no case at all this is a later case,468.11,468.12,468.115,40
00:07:48.120,00:07:52.830,with no case at all this is a later case in red we've also got the classic color,468.12,472.83,470.475,80
00:07:52.830,00:07:52.840,in red we've also got the classic color,472.83,472.84000000000003,472.83500000000004,39
00:07:52.840,00:07:55.430,in red we've also got the classic color wiie blue a coffee color which is my,472.84000000000003,475.43,474.135,76
00:07:55.430,00:07:55.440,wiie blue a coffee color which is my,475.43,475.44,475.435,36
00:07:55.440,00:07:56.950,wiie blue a coffee color which is my personal favorite and then there's,475.44,476.95,476.195,71
00:07:56.950,00:07:56.960,personal favorite and then there's,476.95,476.96,476.955,34
00:07:56.960,00:07:59.149,personal favorite and then there's midnight which is kind of like a double,476.96,479.149,478.05449999999996,74
00:07:59.149,00:07:59.159,midnight which is kind of like a double,479.149,479.159,479.154,39
00:07:59.159,00:08:01.629,midnight which is kind of like a double black black very very black it would go,479.159,481.629,480.394,79
00:08:01.629,00:08:01.639,black black very very black it would go,481.629,481.639,481.634,39
00:08:01.639,00:08:04.990,black black very very black it would go actually quite well with the black color,481.639,484.99,483.3145,80
00:08:04.990,00:08:05.000,actually quite well with the black color,484.99,485.0,484.995,40
